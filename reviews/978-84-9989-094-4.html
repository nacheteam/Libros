	  	<p>I fell in love with Bill Cunningham after watching the documentary <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bill-Cunningham-York-Anna-Wintour/dp/B0050I975Q"><em>Bill Cunningham New York</em></a> about his time as a fashion photographer and writer at the New York Times. When Cunningham died in 2016, he left behind a fully written memoir with instructions to publish it after his death. Someone discovered it in his things and Penguin bought the rights to it.</p>

      <p>This memoir tells the story of the time before he started at the NYTimes. He moved to NYC in the 50s and started designing hats, then later moved on to be a fashion writer at <em>Women’s Wear Daily</em> and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>.</p>

      <p>After reading this memoir, I have a deep appreciation for his independent spirit, his thoughts on creativity and originality, and his complete devotion to his craft.</p>
